An Inferior Version of Pac-Man
Creators - Jeremy Sharapov and Kerry Chen
Idea- Try to replicate Pac-Man to the best of our skills

Bugs
-You can phase into the walls, and so can your ghosty pal
-Both you and him leave behind chunks of your sprites
-Staying stuck int the wall may screw up A* and crash the program

Instructions
-No lives, one ghost, no Power in the pellets stay outside the walls, good luck!
